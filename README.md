# Configuration README

This repository contains configuration instructions and files for setting up a cloud camera.

There are, roughly speaking, three necessary aspects for setting this up:

* [Real-time access](README_Realtime.md) to the camera
* [FTP Server](README_FTP.md) for storing the files
* [Cloud Storage](README_Cloud.md) for backups
