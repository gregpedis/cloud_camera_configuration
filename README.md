# Cloud Camera Configuration

This repository contains configuration instructions and files for setting up a cloud camera.
There are, roughly speaking, three main things necessary for setting this up:

- [Real-time access to the camera](#real-time-access) 
- [FTP Server for storing the files](#ftp-server)
- [Cloud Storage for backups](#cloud-storage)
