# Configuration README

This repository contains configuration instructions and files for setting up a cloud camera.

There are, roughly speaking, three necessary aspects for setting this up:

* [Real-time access](README_Realtime.md) to the camera
* [FTP Server](README_FTP.md) for storing the files
* [Cloud Storage](README_Cloud.md) for backups

---



Also, there are configuration files provided, as well as some helpful examples and details text files.
The files are sorted based on their use case, which results in three folders:

* [ftp](ftp) - Configuration files for the ftp server.
* [cloud](cloud) - Configuration files for the cloud storage.
* [common](common) - Configuration files with general purpose.

The *.txt* files usually are examples, details or cli tool outputs, 
whereas the rest of the files are segments or completed parts of the camera's ocnfriguration.
