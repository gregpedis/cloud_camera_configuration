# Cloud Camera Configuration

This repository contains configuration instructions and files for setting up a cloud camera.
There are, roughly speaking, three main things necessary for setting this up:

* [Real-time access](#real-time-access) to the camera
* [FTP Server](#ftp-server) for storing the files
* [Cloud Storage](#cloud-storage) for backups
